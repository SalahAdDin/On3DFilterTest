# On3DFilterTest

###### 																																	by **José Luis Sandoval Alaguna**

Welcome to the Test project, for enjoying this demo, please follow the next instructions:

1. Do click on `On3DFilterTest.uproject`.
2. Go the *Play* button in the editor window.
3. Enjoy it.

This game is a small *beaten-up* where you have to smash the other enemy characters, for it just move to then with the <kbd>←</kbd> <kbd>↓</kbd> <kbd>→</kbd><kbd>↑</kbd>keys and hit them using the mouse left click, but take care about timing: if you hit at the exact time you can make a second hit in series(combo!).

The game will finish when you have lost your life or when you have defeated all the enemies.

Good luck and Enjoy the game!
